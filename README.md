## Thesis
Theses produced under the Programme shall be of the compilation kind. The thesis should be uploaded in the thesis database of both universities.

### The layout of the text
Make sure that it is obvious that the thesis derives from both universities. This means that some adjustments must be done to the ordinary thesis templates of KI or KTH.

Public defence
Pre-review, decision on examination board, opponent (examiner), time, venue and other matters related to the public defence of a doctoral thesis shall comply with the rules and procedures in effect at the Home university. Copies of decisions made by the Home University and their underlying documentation shall be sent to the other Party well in advance of the defence date.
